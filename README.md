# nlpAssignment1

The goal of this assignment is to build a classifier to classify simple vs. complex words. Simple words are words such as ‘heard’, ‘sat’ while complex words are ‘abdicate’, ‘liaison’, etc. This classification is part of a larger task in NLP called text simplification which replaces complex words with simpler synonyms to make the text more easily understood by younger readers, English as second language speakers, etc. 

1.run hw2_skeleton.py by "python3 hw2_skeleton.py" and the result will just like the result in A1note.docx. and the best result is SVM with 4 features.
2.label.txt is generated by the svm and the four features are: length, frequency, number of synonyms and syllables.
